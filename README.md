# Frontend Mentor - Age calculator app

![Design preview for the Age calculator app coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! 👋

This is a [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenge called Age Calculator. I decided to use Solid JS and vanilla CSS for this project.

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this age calculator app and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
